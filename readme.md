# Student portfolio

This is my personal portfolio in making.
I am Product Support Engineer in a good Product based company.
I was always interested in building things. That is why I got into web development.
But could not find any good teachers and courses.
The way Tanay sir teaches is something special. It has given me hope that I too can learn and do what I am passionate about.
